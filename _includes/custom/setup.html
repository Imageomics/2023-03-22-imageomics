<p>The setup instructions for the Imageomics workshop lessons are the following:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Introduction to Docker</strong>: Please read and follow the <a href="https://imageomics.github.io/docker-workshop/setup.html">setup and installation instructions</a>
      given on the lesson webpage. (The <i>Files to download</i> section can be done at the beginning of the lesson.)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Workflow Automation using Snakemake</strong> requires access to the
      <a href="https://www.osc.edu/" target="_blank">OSC cluster</a>. Please contact
      <a href="https://imageomics.osu.edu/dr.-matthew-thompson">Matthew Thompson</a> to request access.
      To allow time for processing, please submit your request at least 2 workdays prior to the start of the workshop.
    </li>
  </ul>
  Note that there will <strong><i>not</i></strong> be time allocated at the beginning of the lesson for installing software,
  or for creating necessary accounts. Please allow for enough time in advance of the workshop to troubleshoot
  any potential issues.
